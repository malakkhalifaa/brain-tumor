# Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning

This repository presents a deep learning pipeline for **automatic classification of brain tumors** from MRI scans. The model supports four target classes: **glioma**, **meningioma**, **pituitary tumor**, and **no tumor**. It uses **transfer learning** with the **VGG16** architecture for robust feature extraction and is deployed through a fully functional **web interface** for real-time image predictions.

## Project Overview

Brain tumor detection from MRI images is critical for early diagnosis and treatment. Manual analysis is time-consuming and error-prone. This project applies **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to automate tumor classification. The solution includes:

- MRI classification into four categories  
- Transfer learning with VGG16  
- Augmented training for improved generalization  
- Flask and FastAPI web deployment  
- Clean UI for uploading images and displaying predictions

## Dataset Description

- Source: Kaggle - Brain Tumor MRI Dataset  
- Total Images: Over 7,000 MRI scans  
- Classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, notumor  
- Format: .jpg images organized into folders by class  
- Split: 80% training, 20% testing

## Preprocessing

- Image resizing to 128Ã—128  
- Grayscale images converted to RGB  
- Normalization to [0, 1]  
- One-hot encoding of class labels  
- Augmentations used:
  - Random brightness and contrast
  - Rotation
  - Flipping
  - Zoom
  - Width/height shift
